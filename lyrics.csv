8;This was a triumph.
8;Im making a note here:
8;HUGE SUCCESS.
8;Its hard to overstate
8;my satisfaction.
8;Aperture Science
8;We do what we must
8;because we can.
8;For the good of all of us.
8;Except the ones who are dead.
8;
8;But theres no sense crying
8;over every mistake.
8;You just keep on trying
8;till you run out of cake.
8;And the science gets done.
8;And you make a neat gun.
8;For the people who are
8;still alive.

8;And tore me to pieces.
8;And threw every piece into a fire.
8;As they burned it hurt because
8;I was so happy for you!
8;Now these points of data

8;Anyway, this cake is great.
8;Its so delicious and moist.
