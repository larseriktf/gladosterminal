8;
8;This was a triumph.
8;I\'m making a note here:
8;HUGE SUCCESS.
8;It\'s hard to overstate
8;my satisfaction.
8;Aperture Science
8;We do what we must
8;because we can.
8;For the good of all of us.
8;Except the ones who are dead.
8;
8;But there\'s no sense crying
8;over every mistake.
8;You just keep on trying
8;till you run out of cake.
8;And the science gets done.
8;And you make a neat gun.
8;For the people who are
8;still alive.

8;Dear <<Subject Name Here>>,
8;
8;
8;I\'m not even angry.
8;I\'m being so sincere right now.
8;Even though you broke my heart.
8;And killed me.
8;And tore me to pieces.
8;And threw every piece into a fire.
8;As they burned it hurt because
8;I was so happy for you!
8;Now these points of data
8;make a beautiful line.
8;And we\'re out of beta.
8;We\'re releasing on time.
8;So I\'m GLaD. I got burned.
8;Think of all the things we learned
8;for the people who are
8;still alive.

8;One last thing:
8;
8;
8;Go ahead and leave me.
8;I think I prefer to stay inside.
8;Maybe you\'ll find someone else
8;to help you.
8;Maybe Black Mesa...
8;THAT WAS A JOKE. FAT CHANCE.
8;Anyway, this cake is great.
8;It\'s so delicious and moist.
8;Look at me still talking
8;when there\'s science to do!
8;When I look out there,
8;it makes me GLaD Im not you.
8;I\'ve experiments to run.
8;There is research to be done.
8;On the people who are
8;still alive
8;
8;PS: And believe me I am
8;still alive.
8;PPS: I\'m doing Science and I\'m
8;still alive.
8;PPPS: I feel FANTASTIC and I\'m
8;still alive.
8;
8;FINAL THOUGHT:
8;While you\'re dying I\'ll be
8;still alive.

8;And when you\'re dead I will be
