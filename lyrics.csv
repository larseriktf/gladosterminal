\8Test Assessment Report


\8This was a triumph.
\8I'm making a note here:
\8HUGE SUCCESS.
\8It's hard to overstate
\8my satisfaction.
\8Aperture Science
\8We do what we must
\8because we can.
\8For the good of all of us.
\8Except the ones who are dead.

\8But there's no sense crying
\8over every mistake.
\8You just keep on trying
\8till you run out of cake.
\8And the science gets done.
\8And you make a neat gun.
\8For the people who are
\8still alive.

\8Dear <<Subject Name Here>>,


\8I'm not even angry.
\8I'm being so sincere right now.
\8Even though you broke my heart.
\8And killed me.
\8And tore me to pieces.
\8And threw every piece into a fire.
\8As they burned it hurt because
\8I was so happy for you!
\8Now these points of data
\8make a beautiful line.
\8And we're out of beta.
\8We're releasing on time.
\8So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
\8Think of all the things we learned
\8for the people who are
\8still alive.

\8One last thing:


\8Go ahead and leave me.
\8I think I prefer to stay inside.
\8Maybe you'll find someone else
\8to help you.
\8Maybe Black Mesa...
\8THAT WAS A JOKE. FAT CHANCE.
\8Anyway, this cake is great.
\8It's so delicious and moist.
\8Look at me still talking
\8when there's science to do!
\8When I look out there,
\8it makes me GLaD Im not you.
\8I've experiments to run.
\8There is research to be done.
\8On the people who are
\8still alive

\8PS: And believe me I am
\8still alive.
\8PPS: I'm doing Science and I'm
\8still alive.
\8PPPS: I feel FANTASTIC and I'm
\8still alive.

\8FINAL THOUGHT:
\8While you're dying I'll be
\8still alive.

\8FINAL THOUGHT PS:
\8And when you're dead I will be
\8still alive



\8STILL ALIVE
